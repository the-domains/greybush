_Hyper Light Drifter_ is a frantic, graceful and sleek high action role-playing game. TL;DR: [Fucking get it][0]. If you want to know more, read on.

There is essentially no text or spoken lines in this game at all, and yet there is still a language of sorts; the game cleverly uses symbols and images to convey stories and instructions.

This affects the gameplay in a subtle, yet deep way. Since you're not reading text, you must pay closer attention to details in the environment; odd little lights and suspicious platforms often lead to rewarding secret areas and loot. It also allows you to feel emotion more readily in response to the excellent audio and music, since you're not distracted by having to read lengthy exposition.

This game is a definite thumbs-up, and a hearty congratulations also goes to Heart Machine for a successful [Kickstarter campaign][1].
