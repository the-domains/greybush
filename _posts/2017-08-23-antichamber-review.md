# Antichamber Review

A puzzle game that changes when you look away.

_Antichamber_ came out of nowhere but was an instant hit with puzzle game enthusiasts. It's hard not to draw some parallels with _Portal_, in that both games force you to think about a space in new ways; but the similarities end there. As you move and look around, the level itself seems to reconfigure itself in ways seemingly designed to bewilder and confuse. As soon as you think you understand how it works, the game folds over itself and leaves you struggling to keep up.

Expect to be scratching your head often at the beginning, but know that the payoff is worth it. [This one's a get.][0]
