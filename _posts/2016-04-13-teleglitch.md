_Teleglitch_ is brutal; defenestration-of-monitors kind of brutal. You will die, a lot. But if you succeed, it will represent a true achievement.

When you do die, you are starting over basically from the beginning (albeit there are eventually checkpoints, but they are so few and far between that it will take you many tries just to reach the first). Some would argue that this kind of punishment is just intentional inflation of estimated gameplay time, but I posit that like any good rogue-like, it merely lends a real consequence to your actions; you'll ponder your strategies more if death is permanent, and it adds a lot of tension. This tension works really well with the atmosphere and mood of the game's environments.

If you can stick with it, and learn the behaviors of the enemies well enough to succeed, you will be rewarded with personal satisfaction. You can't really put a price on that in my book. Not to mention the gorgeous hybrid of retro meets new-age style of the graphics. [Get it here.][0]
