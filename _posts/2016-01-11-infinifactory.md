_Infinifactory_ is addicting. Really, _really _addicting_. _
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7e873505-40ab-4f30-9fee-f0a47f676202.jpg)

The game's loading screen presents tips, and one of them in particular is ironically amusing; it suggests that a working solution is more important than making one which is fast or elegant. But there it is; fast and elegant solutions are the entire draw of the thing. So addicting they are that a tip had to be written to _remind _the player that they also have to actually solve the problem, and not just endlessly optimize.

And it doesn't stop there; much like _Spacechem, _there are histograms presented when you solve a puzzle, and friends-only leaderboards to instill a sense of competition (and by extension, real accomplishment) which also leads to further optimization. The pull for a puzzle game player is undeniable.

Overall I give the a game a thumbs-up. [Get it!][0]
