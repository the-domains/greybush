# HellDivers Review

_HellDivers _is a solid cooperative multiplayer game. The best way I can describe it is as the unholy offspring of _Magicka _and _Alien Swarm. _If you haven't played either or both of these, no worries.

You and some buddies (or online randos) pick a mission and drop to the surface of a hostile planet in supersonic space pods. Over the course of a mission, you will undoubtedly crush, maim, splatter, riddle full of holes, and burn alive all of them, probably multiple times. But no worries! You can call the ship for more reinforcements as many times as you wish, as long as you're still breathing. The ship (through some sort of arcane tech-wizardry) sends clones of your downed compatriots and in more drop-pods down to the surface to resume the fight alongside you.

With plenty of gear and upgrades to collect, all of it surprisingly useful, and amusing achievements, this game is another no-brainer.
