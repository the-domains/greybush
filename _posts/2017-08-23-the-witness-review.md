# The Witness Review

Attention to detail; mindblowing quality.

Jonathan Blow drops his second masterpiece on us with _The Witness_. On the surface, a puzzle game connecting dots on a grid; underneath, so much more.

Rarely in videogames do we see the level of quality at launch that is delivered here. It has obviously gone through a solid phase of testing and stability, and been scrutinized from every angle by its creator. The striking visual style is also realized consistently, with its solid, bright color and simple shapes. Larger studios should be jealous.

But what of the puzzles themselves, the meat of the game? In a word: _sublime._ The game has no in-game text whatsoever, and all game mechanics are communicated in a visual language of symbols, and interrogated by the player via trial-and-error. As with a newborn, you are taken by the hand and led through a fascinating world filled with things to explore and discover. Each new concept learned rewards you with applications and further exploration. Many secrets hide as well for the overly curious, and are similarly rewarded. Audio logs scattered throughout add some flavor and backstory.

Any puzzle game fan would be crazy not to [buy this instantly.][0]
