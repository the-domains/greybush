Deceptively deep; both strategic and tactical; the ultimate space-nerd game.

_Starsector _(previously: _Starfarer_) is still technically in alpha, but has been in active development for over five years. During that time, its sole developer has released major updates at regular intervals that have progressively expanded its depth and polish. Assuming this trend continues, it will undoubtedly be one of the great space games, harkening back to such classics as _Starflight _and _Star Control 2_.

It provides real-time tactical fleet combat wherein you can pilot your flagship directly, but it also allows you to pass control over to the AI while still giving orders to your fleet in real time. If you'd prefer to not even be bothered with that at all, you can choose to auto-resolve combat (for instance, if the opposing fleet is trivial).

Zooming out a bit, you also move your fleet about in local system space near stars, and in hyperspace between systems; you can interact with other fleets, and with stations and planets to trade and quest and the like. Currently there is also a simulated economy of surprising complexity that takes into account things like market stability, supply, demand, black market availability, and faction favor restrictions. Military goods are available at the higher levels of favor (and you'll definitely want access if you can get it).

All in all, even in its current state (version 0.8.1a as of this writing), it is well worth the asking price. [Get it here.][0]
