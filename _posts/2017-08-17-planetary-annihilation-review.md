# Planetary Annihilation Review

_Uber Entertainment_ decided the time had come to reboot a classic RTS, and weren't satisfied with its first re-incarnation attempt. Let's take a trip in the Way-Back Machine!

Following a [successful Kickstarter campaign][0], Uber was able to truly recapture the magic of the classic _Total Annihilation_ game from the late 90's. In its heyday, _TA's_ active playerbase rivaled, and even briefly exceeded that of _Starcraft_. In this version, you get everything that made its predecessors great (including the "streaming resource" economy model, and the huge battles), but also the ability to literally smash planets into each other as a weapon. What could go wrong?

Knowing full well that the market they were tapping was potentially niche, it was not a sure thing that the campaign would go well. But nostalgia is a powerful drug, and one stretch goal in particular stuck out for me personally as a backer: when they announced that they would be bringing back the original composer: Jeremy Soule. It really just took me back to those golden times and so many fond memories, I could not resist.

Some time passed and eventually they delivered exactly what they said they would, and some expansion content a bit later.

The review is easy though; if you liked _Total Annihilation_ and felt that _Supreme Commander _and its various expansions and sequels were a bit of a let-down, _Planetary Annihilation_ is the one you've been waiting for; don't hesitate.

[Get it on Steam.][1]
