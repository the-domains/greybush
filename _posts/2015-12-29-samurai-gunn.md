_[Samurai Gunn][0]_was released in December of 2013\. Developer _Teknopants _conceived the idea for a fun party game (at a party, natch.), and executed it flawlessly.

Two to four players must sit together around one screen, and brutally murder each other over the span of a minute or so. Picking up the game is supremely easy for newcomers, but true mastery of the game can take a satisfyingly long time. There are a number of deceptively difficult advanced techniques available to an interested player, using only the same basic controls for movement and attack.

The retro-styled graphics are smoothly animated, and blood sprays are appropriately gruesome. Bullets can be deflected (of course!) into opponents, and any match that ends with a tie will move to a head-to-head showdown to determine the overall winner _--- _no guns allowed.

Overall I give this game a thumbs-up. [Get it!][1]
