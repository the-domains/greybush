# Gaming as an Adult

I was born in the mid-eighties and grew up on games like _Super Mario Bros. _and _Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. _As a very young child, I did not game at all (with my parents having little money for it) and spent most of my time outside.

I did have a handful of memorable gaming experience even back then, though; one of my parents was in the business of renting out early computers to try and make some extra money on the side, and as a perk I had access to any of the machines not in use; they lay about the house in every nook and cranny. I was given for my very own an older model IBM PC jr. to mess about with; of note on this machine was the cartridge port on the rear of the case. Instead of booting to the harddrive and normal operating system, a game cart could be inserted to load instead, and I made good use of any games I could get my hands on.

A grandparent once soldered an RCA jack trio belonging to an NES we rented, into the monochrome video input on a black-and-white TV. I think I played _MegaMan 2_ and _Batman_ nonstop for that entire week.

A different grandparent acquired for me a classic GameBoy and a copy of _Pokemon: Red_, which I enjoyed somewhat; but perhaps not as much as some of my peers. It would be the first and last game in the series for me.

Our family got a little bigger though at one point, and we decided to move so that we could bring in more money; around that time I got my first console: a Nintendo 64\. A neighbor acquired a Playstation, and a deep friendship was built on sharing time with various games on both systems. Our respective subscriptions to _Nintendo Power_ and _Playstation Underground _gave us a regular influx of new things to try. _Perfect Dark, Super Smash Bros. _and _Final Fantasy VII_ were some of my most memorable games from that time.

Visiting my two gamer uncles also influenced my tastesa lot. They maintained a classic library of Sega Genesis games, including _Starflight,Star Control, _and _Road Rash. _Any time spent there was pretty much spent in front of it (or playing street hockey --- big time hockey player)

I continued gaming with the Playstation 2, and built a respectable library. _Bloody Roar 3 _and _Gran Turismo 3_ received a lot of my early attention, but before I gifted the system to a relative I had amassed over four dozen full games, and for the most part loved every one. And of course I got some additional mileage out of the system going back and playing the classic PS1 games like _Chrono Cross, _and _The Unholy War_.

I also started gaming on PC a lot more when we got our 28.8k modem; this opened the door to multiplayer _Starcraft _and _Total Annihilation_. The classic _Counter-Strike _and many _SimCity_ games. I also began an interest in programming that would eventually turn into a lifelong career.

Then it was an Xbox360 and later a Playstation 4\. There've been some real gems on both, but not many stick with me like those early ones. Of special note were _Braid_ and _Bloodborne. _I built my own PC to play _Doom 3, _and found a surprising love of _Battlefield 1942\. _I also may have been one of the few truly fanatics of its sci-fi sequel, _2142_, but knowing full well it was not as strong of a game overall as its predecessor. 

That's pretty much my gamer credentials in a nutshell. If you have a similar story, you may find that your tastes align with mine, and maybe we can help each other find some new gaming experiences.
