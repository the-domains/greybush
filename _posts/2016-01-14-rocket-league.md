It's a simple-seeming game on the surface. Drive a car around a caged arena, smack into a ball. Ball go in net. But underneath the simple premise is a solid physics-based engine to inhabit, and some beautiful _Unreal Engine _-driven graphics. The network connectivity has remained remarkably stable, despite the few minor outages; far fewer, it should be noted, than one might think given _Psyonix's _recent meteoric rise to success. The fact that the game was completely gratis to PS+ subscribers during the month of its initial release no doubt helped here.

True mastery of the game, like many physics-based skill games, is a serious endeavor, and the top tier players bask in the attention of the gaming internet with highly popular channels, and e-sports leagues galore. It is deeply satisfying to learn a new technique and expand your understanding of the mechanics.

Add to that the miniscule prices of the DLC on offer so far, along with the completely free maps and mutator settings and special events, and _Rocket League _is a no-brainer. [Get it!][0]
