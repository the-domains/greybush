# Absolver Review

_Sloclap_'s first game is stylish, minimalist and focused.

_Absolver_ is first and foremost a fighting game. The menus and user interface elements in general are minimalist and never gets in the way or feels slow. No-nonsense menu options let you customize your character at altars (think: bonfires from _Dark Souls_), and matchmake for best-of-5 1v1 duels. Connection to matches is also snappy, and rematches are instantaneous for as many times as the two players desire.

Character customization is deep and meaningful, while also being approachable and easy to grasp. You can change your _mobility _stat (speed) by changing your equipment and clothing; this also affects your character's appearance. You can also define what the game calls your _combat deck_; your list of combos and fight moves. You learn new moves while fighting enemies and players. The list of moves is large and gratifying, and executing them is always seamless.

Combat is also deceptively simple-seeming, but actually has a high skill ceiling. A single button executes the move for the current stance (of four possible stances), and a second button is used for alternate moves; both types of move are set by the player in advance with their deck. Moves change stances, and how they chain together is also completely up to the player. Moves are also affected by your stats and character level.

The art style is pure and colorful; the music is fantastic. The fight system is deep but approachable, and the network play and menus are no-nonsense. _Sloclap_ has delivered on every promise they made, and it is exactly what we were told we'd get.

There is one caveat, though; the single-player experience is a bit on the short side. If you play offline and intend to shy away from player-vs-player combat, this one might not be worth the asking price for you, at the moment. For myself, I immensely enjoy the PvP mindgames and multiplayer aspects of this game and of similar interactions in _From Software's_ games.

Overall, this game still gets a big thumbs-up. [Get it here.][0]
