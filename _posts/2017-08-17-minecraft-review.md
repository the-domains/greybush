# Minecraft Review

If you haven't heard of _Minecraft_ by now, you have probably also never played a game before. So, this review is for you. Why should you care about Minecraft, anyway?

When you were younger, did you ever play with _Lego?_ Ah, those rainbow colored bricks, boxes and boxes of them. Endless creation. That, in a nutshell, is Minecraft. It is a most accessible game with many qualities of sandbox toys like Lego.

The game has been around a while, and has gone through many changes over the years. That history is interesting, but it's not really why you're here. You want to know why you should bother to get into games now, in your adulthood, having never or very infrequently played any game. What makes Minecraft different or special?

It comes down to accessibility. There is really no one I can think of who couldn't play this game. A two-year-old could probably get enjoyment from it. With that in mind, it is also very powerful. All of the basic building-blocks of the game have their own properties and rules that they follow. Very complex creations can arise from these simple rules; and if you prefer not to have to deal with the survival aspects of the game (zombies, skeletons and the like), the creative mode allows for free flight, unlimited blocks, and no lifebars.

I don't think _Mojang_ knew what they were getting into when they wrote the original browser applet version of the game, but today few games tower as tall as Minecraft. Truly a giant among indies. [Obviously.. get it.][0]
