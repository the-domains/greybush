# Nidhogg II Review

The sequel to the venerable couch fencing game absolutely improves upon its concept in every way, without leaving anything behind.

Many of the additions to _Nidhogg_ would seem to be merely visual, but actually there are entirely new weapons, and the online multiplayer is much more robust and easy to use. Everything that made the original great is still there, along with character customizations, and a beautiful new art style.

Standing applause for you, _Messhof_. You've outdone yourself with this one.

Oh, and [get it on Steam, here.][0]
