# For Honor Review

There's a lot to love about this innovative new fighter, but there's also a lot to hate.

_For Honor_ is a 3rd-person fighting game which allows fights with multiple simultaneous opponents. It uses a three-stance directional system for basic attacks and blocks, and most characters have an accessible moveset that also manages to leave room for a very high skill ceiling and master-level mindgames. Overall the fighting system, while complicated, is very satisfying and can take a great deal of time to master.

The mechanics of the game have had some problems though; "turtling" can still be a bit of a problem, with players only making "safe" moves when possible, which can make for dreary, boring-to-watch matches. The tournament scene has been plagued with exploits and glitches.

I have a complicated relationship with this title. Having spent upwards of 600 hours playing it, you would think that I'd be chomping at the bit to recommend it to everyone.. but that's not the case. Along the way I've experienced game-breaking bugs aplenty, server downtime has become a running gag, and even the dank memes on /r/ForHonor aren't enough to lighten the mood some days.

I'm going to have to recommend you stay away from this one.
