These days, it seems that the success or failure of a game is roughly proportional to how "streamable" it is. Meaning, if people who like watching games being played like watching your game, it has a chance for stratospheric levels of success. Well, this definitely seems to be the case for BlueHole's new shooter.

The high-level concept of PUBG is _Hunger Games_ (but faster and more brutal). Last man standing wins. Teams of up to four players are allowed, but you can also queue alone. Squad play is quite different from solo play, and the queues also differentiate between 3rd-person being allowed or forced-first-person viewpoints. Death is permanent and if you die, you are out for the rest of the round. To force conflicts, the playable area shrinks in a randomized way, causing players to die, or meet (and then die). These mechanics together mean that as you progress through a game, and get closer to the end, you get more and more attached to your character; meaning, you begin to fear death more and more because of time and effort invested. The adrenaline gets pumping pretty quickly.

The game already has support for multi-seat vehicles with physics, and a large island map to explore and loot with lots of hiding places. While the map layout and geometry is static, loot and vehicle distribution is randomized, with certain locations intentionally being hotspots for good gear. Air-dropped loot crates tempt bold players and force additional conflicts. Squad communication is vital in team play, and immensely rewarding for the clever.
