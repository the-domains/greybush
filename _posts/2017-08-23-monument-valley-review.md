# Monument Valley Review

Beautiful but not particularly challenging; excellent for killing some time.

If you sit down and play _Monument Valley_ like a traditional puzzle game, you will burn through the content in a single sitting, as it's rather short. However, as a mobile game, I think it is much better suited as a game to be played in-between. A minute there, fifteen here, sort of thing. Consumed in bite-sized morsels, it can be a wonderful escape.

In terms of quality, it's among my picks for best mobile games of all time; the visual style and polish are top-tier. The puzzles, while sometimes rather simple, are still a joy to complete. The characters are cute (but not overmuch).

I only wish there were more. [Get it here.][0]
