# Factorio Review

Wube software has a real gem on their hands.

_Factorio_ might be the ultimate sandbox game; a creative tool allowing for truly intricate machines. Named for the tendency for these creations to resemble factories, many other unrelated things are absolutely possible. And that's not including the (extensive) library of user-created mods for the game already available.

Like _Don't Starve, Terraria_ and _Minecraft_ before it, there is a survival element to the creative process that adds a sense of urgency. It comes to this game in the form of a sprawling, infinite alien horde which objects to the pollution your factories generate. On your quest to launch a spaceworthy rocket, you will encounter them frequently.

One pleasant surprise for me though was the overall quality. Despite still being in alpha, the game is already heavily optimized, and fully supports online multiplayer play, with optional mods. I have seen 100+ player servers online at times. The quality shows though, and actually the way I discovered the game was via its Steam Reviews. For a time it was the highest reviewed game on Steam _of all time._ That is a significant and well-earned achievement.

If you are a sandbox gamer, [this one should be a top pick. Get it.][0]--- Trylobot
