# Crawl Review

_Crawl_ is a piece of local multiplayer genius. You and up to three friends take turns controlling a hero. As the hero, you want to level up and escape the dungeon. Everyone else is pitted _against _the hero, as the various hazards of the dungeon (including the bosses!).

They release new content for the game on a swift and regular beat, in the form of: new room layouts and art, new monsters, weapons, items and other bits of polish; rewards for keeping tabs on their blog are delicious.

I really can't gush enough about the game. Everything about it screams polish, from the gorgeous pixel graphics and supremely smooth animations, to the nostalgic sound effects and menu announcer. The game isn't finished yet, but it is highly playable and even quite well balanced even in its current state. Developer _Powerhoof_ is staffed by a tight-knit group of industry vets, and it shows in the overall quality and presentation of the game.

At the start of a session, one player will be randomly selected as the hero. If you can't gather up four humans to play at the same time, never fear; the computer players can substitute for humans quite convincingly even at this early stage. They have human-feeling reaction lag and various behavioral details that sometimes make me stop and try and remember who was the computer player and who was the human.

The hero sprints from room to room evading traps and slaying beasts for XP, standard RPG fare. But eventually she meets her match; at which point one of the other spirits (players) steals the humanity (apparently a standard dungeon commodity, transferrable endlessly).

There is no apparent limit on how many times the humanity can change hands, but it's in your best interest to hang onto it as long as possible. It's of course also in the best interest of each spirit to do as much damage as possible to the hero, as you get paid directly in gold, exchanged for pints of hero blood spilled. Spirits do damage via traps fixed to the walls and floors, as monsters selected randomly from their personal stable derived from their chosen god of worship, or as slimes they bring into being from ectoplasm gathered in the dungeon (usually as a last-ditch effort to overwhelm an already-weak hero).

Eventually, though, a hero gathers enough XP to reach level 10, and things get serious. If that hero reaches a portal room, they can immediately challenge a boss (controlled by the other players). If the hero wins the fight, the game is over and the hero wins the session. However if the boss wins, the hero is ejected from the portal back into the dungeon. In any given gaming session, the portal can be activated only three times, even if all three are used by the same player. If the boss wins on the third attempt, though, the _boss_ wins and all human players lose. The player who controlled the hero at that time gets _consumed_ and their name deleted from the high-score register! Runners-up are determined by total XP gained during the session. It all feels very satisfying and arcade-y.
