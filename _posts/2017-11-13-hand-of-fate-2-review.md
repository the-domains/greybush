# Hand of Fate 2 Review

This return to the combination action-game / board-game genre is definitely worth consideration.

The original _Hand of Fate_ was a welcome surprise; an interesting mix of chance-based minigames, strategy, roguelikes, and action. The fighting was similar to _Batman: Arkham Asylum_, in a good way, but the animations were not nearly as smooth. The types of chance games were few though (basically limited to different variations of pick-one-of-four and cross your fingers), and the movement between rooms in the dungeons was severely limited by food, so exploration was heavily discouraged. The boss fights were fun, though, and overall the game was rewarding, with tons of content to unlock.

This new sequel is the perfect follow-up. The types and variations of chance games have been expanded in fantastic ways, with companions that can improve your odds in various selected games. The objectives vary widely between the different dungeons as well (whereas in the original, the objective was always: get to the end, kill the boss). There are also side objectives that grant greater rewards.

The combat engine has been vastly improved as well; all of the animations are much smoother, as well as the feel of the controls. More variation in weapon types and effects are seen, as well as rock-paper-scissors style countering for various offensive and defensive setups that are much more meaningful.

Exploration is also practical now. Instead of expending a food and healing hitpoints for every movement in a dungeon, previously-explored rooms grant free movement. So, you only use food and heal when exploring new rooms, which makes fully-exploring a floor a more strategic choice rather than a tactical one.

There are many other small additions that increase the depth of the cards and add variation over the original, and all are welcome. [This game is a solid "get."][0]
