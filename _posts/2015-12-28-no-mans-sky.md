_No Man's Sky_ might just change everything. It has become the most anticipated game of the year, and captured the attention of gamers young and old.

> Release date: June 2016

_Hello Games_, the independent developer building the game, has shown some impressive demos over the past two years. They've made some pretty bold claims, and there are a lot of questions among both the rabid fans and the skeptics; but here's what you need to know:

• This game is _big_. Explore it for years; you won't even scratch the surface.

• Genuinely original: a designer's hand guides the procedural generation, a ghost in the machine; the scenery is _beautiful. _Inspired by the sweeping majesty of the Australian outback.

_• Dangerous. _Everywhere you go, there will be things trying to kill you. It could be space pirates, it could be six-legged acid-spitting fauna. 

• Most importantly, _mysterious._ No one yet knows the underlying fabric of the game's story, or even the identity of the protagonist. But it has been stated that ruins and artifacts that exist in the game have been designed according to a secretive overarching plot that must be unearthed via play. 

Come June 2016, we'll all hop in our starfighters and ply our chosen trade as we race for the center of the universe. I don't usually do previews, but I'm calling this one early: it's a thumbs-up. [Get it.][0]
