_Hello Games _released the game in August of 2016, and every day leading up to it was filled with wonder and anticipation. Even I was roped in to the unbelievable feeling of excitement they had whipped up, seemingly unintentionally.

There are a few interesting things to be seen on the various types of environments the game engine can generate, and some are quite odd and unique.

Playing the actual game though, is sadly much different than what most fans had projected they would be doing. The game systems surrounding the basics of play are quite shallow and become boring within the first hour of play. After that it's a dull grind with very little payoff: reaching the game's final objective leaves most with a sour taste in their mouth.

I'm going to have to recommend you avoid this one. Do not get.
