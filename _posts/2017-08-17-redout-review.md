If you fondly remember _Wipeout_ or _Extreme-G_, don't even read this review, [just get it.][0]

_Redout_ is silky-smooth and blindingly fast. Underneath the gorgeous graphics is a solid arcade racer that even manages to bring some interesting new gameplay mechanics to the table. Bonus: if you've a VR-capable rig, it also does that.

_34BigThings_ has added the constraint that your vehicle's human driver can only withstand a human amount of G-force, and so to compensate you must manually adjust your car's center of gravity using sci-fi tech mumbo jumbo. The end result is that while you're steering around the tracks at a thousand km/h (not even an exaggeration), you're also required to lean up and down in order to stave off a blackout (or a redout!). This added complexity is engaging and thoughtful, and really keeps you on your toes. Doing hot laps on a track and memorizing the layout is even more important than in other arcade racers. If you'll remember, _F-Zero_ had a vaguely similar feature that allowed you to make tighter turns and such and was great fun, but it was not possible to pass out.

Being an arcade racer there are of course many varied racing modes, some of which involve powerups and combative elements, but it still mostly boils down to speed and track knowledge. My favorite modes are the pure racing ones of course, because the feeling of speed is just spot-on.
